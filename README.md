# MultiThreadWebScrape
This is a Java gui that uses JSoup library to conduct a multi-threaded web search for a product on eBay, Best Buy, Amazon, and Newegg. This was an assignment for school, but I will continue to develop it here and allow others to use it as well if needed.
The Amazon Object does not work because I am not using the Amazon API, therefore many requests cause the site to think the program is a robot meant to DDoS instead of actually return information.
If there is any error with the MyJSoup library not being found, I provided the jar file in the package to just re-add it to the library.
